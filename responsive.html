            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we were given a barebones zip file containing HTML, CSS and Java Script files. The HTML file had the "skeleton" of the page, with nothing in the css or Java Script file. We were asked to use and apply CSS Flex and Grid methods to style this landing page and to make it a responsive layout.</p>
            <p>I had a very all over the place approach to it, but the development process started with me creating a navigation bar and footer that were responsive, adding media queries to elements, necessary for a responsive layout. I wanted to create everything mobile first, as any respected front end developer would, but I was distracted with having the larger view of sections first.</p>
            <p>I followed the instructions left in comments inside the HTML file in order to create a solution that would meet all these requirements. Adding images where needed, switching layout where intended. The landing page switches to a one column layout for mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, polishing elements such as cards or a message form, used in previous assignments was interesting, as I used different approaches before for styling.</p>
            <p>The link for the solution can be found in the breadcrumbs - Responsive Design.</p>
